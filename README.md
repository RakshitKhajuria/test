# Contributing to LangTest

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LangTest! We value the contributions of our community members and are excited to have you on board. To ensure a smooth and collaborative development process, please follow these guidelines:

## Step 1: Finding an Issue

1. Visit our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/YourUsername/LangTest/issues) to find a list of open issues.
2. Look for issues that align with your skills and interests. Feel free to ask for clarification or more information on any issue.

## Step 2: Contribution Process

### Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

### Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/langtest.git
```

where `username` is your GitHub username.

### Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd langtest
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout -b` command:

```
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

### Make necessary changes and commit those changes 

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add .
```
Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add feature: feature-name" 
```

### Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.



### Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

### Create a pull request (PR)

Create a pull request (PR) from your forked repository to the main LangTest repository.
- Clearly describe the changes you've made and the issue it addresses in the PR description.
- If the PR is related to an existing issue, mention it using the syntax "Fixes #issue_number."
> For pull request template click [here](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

Soon we'll be merging all your changes into the main branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.

## Step 3: Proposing a New Issue

1. If you have an idea for a new feature, improvement, or bug fix, you can propose a new issue.
2. Go to the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/issues) and click on "New Issue" or just create a new issue from [here](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/issues/new) 
3. Choose the appropriate issue lables (feature, fix, bug, etc.).
4. Provide a clear and concise title and description of the proposed issue.
5. Add labels and assignees, if applicable, to help categorize and track the issue.

We're excited to have you on board with us! Together, we can make NLP models safer, more reliable, and fairer for everyone. 

**Happy contributing!** ðŸ’«
